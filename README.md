# 🧮 KNN Algorithm Simulation with Pure Python

This project is an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, developed from scratch using only pure Python. The goal is to demonstrate the fundamentals of KNN on a Cartesian plane by classifying new points based on their nearest neighbors.

## 🚀 Features

- Define points on the Cartesian plane (X, Y) with targets of either 0 or 1.
- Add new points and determine their target based on the K nearest neighbors.
- Calculate distances between points using the Euclidean distance metric.
- A simple and practical simulation to study and understand the basic functioning of KNN.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Initialization:**  
   The Cartesian plane is filled with predefined points, each having (X, Y) coordinates and a classification target (0 or 1).

2. **Adding a New Point:**  
   A new point is added to the plane by defining its coordinates.

3. **Setting the Value of K:**  
   The user selects the number of nearest neighbors to be considered for classification.

4. **Classification:**  
   The algorithm calculates the distances between the new point and all existing points, selects the K nearest neighbors, and assigns the predominant target to the new point.
